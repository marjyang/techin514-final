# Smart Shower Feedback System

This device focuses on the issue of water usage waste and awareness during long showers - an important issue for utility bills and sustainability.

This system will monitor real-time water usage directly from the shower head (sensing device) and provide feedback to users with a meter and OLED on the other side of the shower wall (display device) to remind users of their water consumption habits. Users will also be able to set weekly water consumption goals.
